## 🎯 Our Mission

**Meowrch** started as a project to create the perfect Arch Linux configuration. But we didn't stop there.

Every day, Linux users face problems—missing features, clunky workflows, unsolved tasks. **We see opportunities in these gaps.**

Our mission is simple: **Find real problems. Create elegant solutions. Share them with everyone.**

We solve tasks that matter to the community. Not because it's easy, but because it's necessary.

## 💎 Projects

### **[Meowrch](https://github.com/meowrch/meowrch)** — *The Foundation*
> *Beautiful dotfiles for Arch Linux with Hyprland and BSPWM*

Where it all began. A meticulously crafted configuration pushing the boundaries of performance, ergonomics, and aesthetics. Pre-configured hotkeys, modern design, automated installation—everything you need for a ready-to-work desktop.

**Built for creators. Optimized for productivity.**

***

### **[Nemo Tags](https://github.com/meowrch/nemo-tags)** — *Solving a 10-Year Problem*
> *Powerful tagging system for the Nemo file manager*

For 10 years, Nemo users asked for one feature: **file tags**. No one did it. So we did.

- Color organization
- Virtual tag folders with symbolic links
- Context menu integration
- Visual emblems on file icons
- Lightweight JSON storage

**No database servers. No cloud sync. Just tags that work.**

***

### **[BlueVein](https://github.com/meowrch/BlueVein)** — *Bluetooth Keys in Unity*
> *Sync Bluetooth pairing keys between Windows and Linux in dual-boot*

Tired of re-pairing Bluetooth devices every time you switch OS? BlueVein automatically syncs pairing keys, making dual-boot seamless.


***

### **[fat32-raw](https://github.com/meowrch/fat32-raw)** — *Direct Filesystem Access*
> *Rust library for working with unmounted FAT32 partitions*

Born from the needs of BlueVein, `fat32-raw` provides direct read/write access to FAT32 without mounting. Built in Rust for safety and performance.

***

### **[Pawlette](https://github.com/meowrch/pawlette)** — *Theme Management Reimagined*
> *Universal theme manager with Git-based version control*

Switch themes without losing personal settings. Pawlette uses Git under the hood to track every change, creating a branch for each theme and preserving your customizations.

**Features:**
- Modular configuration handlers
- Atomic patching operations (prepaw/postpaw/jsonpaw)
- XDG standard compliance
- Smart cache and temp file filtering
- Full version history for every theme

**Your themes, your way. Always reversible.**

***

### **[Mewline](https://github.com/meowrch/mewline)** — *All in One*
> *Elegant status bar + Dynamic Island for Wayland*

Status bar, app launcher, wallpaper picker, emoji picker, clipboard manager, network manager, Bluetooth manager, OCR, notifications — **15+ widgets in one utility**.

Instead of configuring Rofi + Waybar + Dunst + wlogout + a pile of scripts — **one installation command**.

**Compact interface. Maximum functionality.**
